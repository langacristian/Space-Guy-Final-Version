Rules of the game

In this game you are a spaceship,your purpose is to prevent the enemy spaceships which drop down
from above from reaching the bottom of the screen, you do that by shooting the enemies.Every time an
enemy reaches the bottom of the screen ,you lose one life,if you lose all of your lives,it’s game over.The
enemies will also fire bullets,which you must avoid,also avoid touching the enemies,as touching an
enemy or a bullet fired by an enemy will drain your health,and once all of your health is drained,it’s
game over.The enemies will come in waves,as indicated on the top left corner of your screen.The first
wave of enemies you will have you fight off consists of 5 enemy spaceships,after destroying allspaceships you will progress unto the next wave,which will have even more enemy spaceships for you to
fight,and the spaceships will move slightly faster.
